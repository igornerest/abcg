## CG Applications

- **[Flappy ~~Bird~~ Pacman](https://igornerest.github.io/abcg/public/flappybird/index.html)**: tap the screen to make your bird fly. If you hit a pipe, your bird falls and you restart the game. The further you go, the higher your score will become (but the game also gets harder).
